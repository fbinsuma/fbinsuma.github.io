    <h2>Digital Main Street (ShopHere Powered by Google)</h2>
    <h4>UI designer/E-Commerce coordinator</h4>
    <p>
      Designed and developed E-Commerce website for 20+ small to medium business based on the clients needs, creating user-interface, 
      digitalizing products and SEO strategies.
       Multiple of my websites were showcased in weekly meetings for UX experience.

    <h2>ETA Tool</h2>
    <h4>UI/UX designer and web developer</h4>
    <p>The ETA Tool all began when me and 3 of my classmates joining the Calgary Hackathon 2019. The hackathon was two days event, and the topic was pedestrian safety. 
      We came up with the idea of creating a tool that would bring the City of Calgary to Vision Zero goal. The web tool visualized to the end user that speed 
      reduction can have minimal affect on your commute but can saves many lives as it can reduce the force of collision. After creating a demo tool for the hackathon, the City of Calgary contact us to develop the tool as the city was looking for an app that can help both the City engineers and the public to visualize those speed reduction changes.
      
      <br>or this tool we created a website using JavaScript, HTML and CSS so it can be accessible to as many people. 
      We also use GIS to compile and compress the city data to have a fast user experience.<br>

    <h2>Camrose boys and girls club</h2>
    <h4>UI designer/Lead web developer</h4>
    <p>
      In my last 2-years of University I had a practicum with a team of 3 people. 
      We worked the Camrose boys and girls club management who were looking for a 
      desktop app that is able to take in registrations, sends thank you notes and 
      prints out reports based on clients requirements. 
      <br>
      In our first year our group meet with client and designed a fully functional user-interface based on requirement. 
      The next time we meet the client we were able to create a database and connect it to the user-interface making a 
      fully functional desktop app that is fully customized to clients needs.<br>
      
      For this desktop app we used electron, along with html, CSS and PHP to create the user-interface as for the database we use MySQL

      <div class="col"><p>My name is Fatima Bin Sumait I am a recent graduate of the Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Alberta. 
        In my first year I attended the university of Calgary Business program following my fathers’ footsteps, but I knew that it wasn’t for me. 
        At the beginning of my second year, I decided that I am going to switch my major, so I booked an appointment the next day with a 
        career path coach in the University. </p>
      <p>That same day I was helping my brother investigate different degrees he might be interested in and then I came across the 
        Computer Science field. It loves at first sight; it was the perfect program for me, but I brushed it off and went to the career coach. 
        At the career coach office, I took a couple of tests to tell you which degree you should be pursing based on personalities, skills and 
        way of learning. I waited for the career coach to share with me his results and what you know he recommended me to do Computer Science. 
        In that moment I knew I belong in the computer science field, and it was now time to convince my parents of the switch from degrees and 
        University to follow my dream. </p></div>

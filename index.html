    <h2>ETA Tool</h2>
    <h4>UI/UX designer and web developer</h4>
    <p>The ETA Tool all began when me and 3 of my classmates joing the Calgary Hackathon 2019. The hackthone was two days event and the topic was
      padestrain safety. We came up with the idea of creating a tool that would bring teh City of Calgary to Vision Zero goal. The web tool visualizaed
      to the end user that speed reduction can have minial affect on your cmmute but can saves many lives as it can reduce the force of collision. After creating a demo tool for the hacthone the City of Calgary contact us to develope the tool as the City was looking for an app that
      can help both the CIty engineers and the public to visiualize those speed reduction changes.
      
      <br>For this tool we created a website using Javascript, HTML and CSS so it can be accessible to as many people. We also use GIS to compile and compress
    the city data to have a fast user experince.<br>

    <h2>Camrose boys and girls club</h2>
    <h4>Lead web developer</h4>
    <p>It is quite a task thinking up great made-up words that are unique, 
      so I created this word generator to help you come up with the best fake 
      word ideas. They can be great for naming your website, business, product 
      or project. Fake words or pseudowords are words which look like they are 
      real, but actually have no meaning. They are easy to pronounce, and this 
      also helps to make them sound like they are real. Pseudowords have been 
      around ever since our brain evolved the ability to process language, it 
      is probably how all our modern day words came into being. A language has 
      a lot of sounds called phonemes which when used in various combinations, 
      you can create relatable sounds that do not have any meaning behind them, 
      this is where a meaning could be attached to a sound to create a new word.</p>

      <p>This fake word generator will generate all kinds of words, some put words 
      together, others are totally new! You can also keep a short list of fake 
      words that you like by clicking on that word in the list under the generator 
      named 'fake words generated'. If you have a fake word you would like to add 
      to the fake word generator contact us and we will add it to the list.</p>
